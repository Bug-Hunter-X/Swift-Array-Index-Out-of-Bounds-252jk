This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift: an array index out of bounds. The `bug.swift` file shows the erroneous code that attempts to access an element beyond the array's valid index range, resulting in a runtime crash. The `bugSolution.swift` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.
